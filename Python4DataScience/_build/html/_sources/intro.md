# Data Science Interview Preparation

Hello there, I am Nabin Oli. I am second year student pursuing Bachelor of Data Science at Sunway College Kathmandu. Beyong my academics, I am working as Research Intern at Center for Artificial Intelligence Research Nepal also known as CAIR-Nepal in short.I'm passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI. As a second-year student, our third year involves placement internships, which are mandatory for our Bachelor's degree. To prepare for this, I'm revisiting Python. I invite you to join me; I'll be sharing valuable content that will benefit both of us. Together, we'll delve into Python on a website that covers it comprehensively, promising a learning experience like never before.
